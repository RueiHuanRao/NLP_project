# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Application on Chat-Bots

`By “natural language”, it always means a language that is used for everyday communication by humans; languages such as English, French, or Mandarin. In contrast to “artificial languages” like programming languages, natural languages are developed “naturally” and evolve as they pass from generation to generation. It is hard to nail down as there is no explicit rules.`

`The ultimate goal of NLP is to let computers understand even comprehend the semantics of natural languages as well as human do, as a result the development of the relative applications can be realised for instance sentiment analysis, speech recognition, virtual assistants, picture depictions, chat-bots, machine translation and much more.`

`The aim of this report is to briefly demonstrate artificial intelligent chat-bots via three different approaches. Here, the procedure of each approach will be introduced step by step, and then the algorithms which have been applied will be explained later on.`

Chat-bots have been made by three different methods in this project.
1. Transformers chat-bot
2. Intents-based machine learning chat-bot
3. Article-based similarity chat-bot
